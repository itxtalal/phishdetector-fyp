## About The Project

This project aims to develop a comprehensive solution for phishing site detection and protection. It includes the development of a browser extension, an admin dashboard, a demo marketing page, API endpoints, a machine learning model, and integration with cloud hosting services.

## Features
- Browser Extension: Developed using React and Typescript, the browser extension provides real-time protection against phishing attacks. It utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to detect malicious URLs and alerts users.

- Admin Dashboard: The admin dashboard, built with React and Typescript, offers analytics and management functionalities. It includes charts and data visualizations to provide insights into detected phishing sites.

- Demo Marketing Page: A demo marketing page is developed to showcase the features of the anti-phishing tool. It provides information about the project and its capabilities.

- API Endpoints: API endpoints are implemented using Python and FastAPI. They facilitate communication between the browser extension and the backend system, allowing for real-time reporting and retrieval of information on phishing sites.

- Machine Learning Model: A machine learning model is developed to detect phishing sites. It leverages features such as URL structure, content, and metadata to accurately identify potential threats.

- Cloud Integration: The project is integrated with cloud hosting services such as Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for hosting and scalability. Nginx is used for load balancing, ensuring efficient handling of a large number of requests.

## Built With

This project was built using the following major frameworks:

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Typescript: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- FastAPI: A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python.
- PyTorch: A popular machine learning library for building deep learning models.
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP): A suite of cloud computing services for hosting and scaling applications.
- Nginx: A web server and reverse proxy server for efficient load balancing.

These frameworks were chosen for their reliability, performance, and extensive community support, ensuring a robust and scalable solution for the project.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

* npm

```sh
npm install npm@latest -g
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/itxtalal/phishdetector-fyp.git
```

2. Install NPM packages

```sh
npm install
```

3. Install NPM packages for the required module

For Example for browser extensions,

4. Navigate to the frontend folder

```sh
cd frontend
```

5. Build the files for your browser

```sh
npm run build:<browser>
```
replace `<browser>` with a name like `chrome`

6. Load the files in the browser extension manually.

7. Enjoy
